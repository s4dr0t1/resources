CS695 at IIT Bombay | This course covers basic and advanced concepts related to the virtualization and how it enables the latest revolution of cloud computing. You will understand the various virtualization paradigms of full virtualization, para virtualization, and hardware-assisted virtualization, for CPU, memory, and I/O. You will also learn about containers and related concepts. The later part of the course will cover various advanced topics related to virtual machine live migration, modern cloud storage frameworks, and so on. The programming assignments in the course are designed to reinforce the concepts learnt in class.  | [Link](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/virtcc/) | `hypervisor`, `virtualization`, `containers`
